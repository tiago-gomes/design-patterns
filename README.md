# What is a Design Pattern?
A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common software design problem, providing a template for efficient and maintainable code.

## Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is a software design pattern where the components of a system receive their dependencies from an external source, rather than creating them internally. It helps in achieving loosely coupled and more maintainable code by allowing dependencies to be injected from the outside, often through constructor injection or method injection.

## Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It involves defining an interface or abstract class for creating objects and letting the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern promotes flexibility and helps in creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows a client to choose an appropriate algorithm at runtime without altering the code that uses it. By encapsulating algorithms in separate classes and making them interchangeable, it promotes flexibility and helps in selecting and using algorithms dynamically.
